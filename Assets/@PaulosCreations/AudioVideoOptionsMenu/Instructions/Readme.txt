!! First thing to do is !!
Go to the "_Packages" folder and install the >BuitIn< or >URP< pack Depending on wich one you want to use.

All you need to do is drag the "_OptionsMenu_Combined" prefab into the first scene of your Game/Project.
!!Please make sure you have a "EventSystem" added to every scene or the canvas will not work.

The URP version and Audio menu require a little more setup, Instructions are included

(Adding the prefab to a later scene is fine too, but be aware the menu is set to "DontDestroyOnLoad()".
Reloading a scene/level that is build with the menu already in it will add an aditional menu prefab to the scene)

Select how you want to save (playerPrefs or .ini file). 
Saving to .ini file will create a text file in your build projects folder called "QualitySettings.ini".
(When running in the unity editor it will save to the main asset folder of your project).

To open the Combined menu in game press Escape (but you can change this to any Key/Button you want).

On each script, in the editor there is an Used/notUsed setting for every menu option.
Options set to UnUsed can savely be disabled/Removed from the menu UI;
